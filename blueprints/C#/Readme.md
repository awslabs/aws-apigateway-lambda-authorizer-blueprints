# AWS Lambda Custom Authorization Template

This services as boilerplate code for a API Gateway custom authorization Lambda function.

It authorizes *any* token, granting S3 notifications to a dummy bucket. This code is merely acts as a sample for API gateway custom authorization, and should not be utilized in production as it allows any token. An authorization method should be incorporated before deployment.
