# Amazon API Gateway - Custom Authorizer Blueprints for AWS Lambda
We've added blueprints and examples in 3 languages for Lambda-based custom Authorizers for use in API Gateway.

## Java
Not available in the Lambda console. Use the AuthPolicy object to generate and serialize IAM policies for your custom authorizer. See javadoc comments for more details.

## NodeJS
Also available in the Lambda console, the NodeJS blueprint makes it easy to generate IAM policies, including Conditions.

## Python
Also available in the Lambda console, the Python blueprint includes the AuthPolicy class, which makes generating IAM policies simple and easy to understand.

## Go
Not available in the Lambda console. Use the AuthorizerResponse object to generate IAM policies for your custom authorizer. See comments for more details.

## Rust
Not available in the Lambda console. Using `awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime`. Use the APIGatewayPolicyBuilder object to generate IAM policies for your custom authorizer. See comments for more details.
